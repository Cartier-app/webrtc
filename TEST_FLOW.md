## üéØ Quick Test (2 Users)

### Scenario: Alice creates a room, Bob joins

#### Step 1: Alice Creates a Room

1. Open the application in **Browser Tab 1** (or Device 1)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Your Name:** `Alice`
   - **Room Code:** Leave empty
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Video:** Checked
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Audio:** Checked
3. Click **"Create New Room"**
4. Grant camera/microphone permissions when prompted
5. Note the **room code** displayed (e.g., `ABC123`)
6. You should see:
   - Your own video feed (labeled "You")
   - Participant count: `1 participants`
   - Your name in the participants list

#### Step 2: Bob Joins the Room

1. Open the application in **Browser Tab 2** (or Device 2)
   - **Tip:** Use incognito/private mode for testing locally
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Your Name:** `Bob`
   - **Room Code:** `ABC123` (the code from Step 1)
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Video:** Checked
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Audio:** Checked
3. Click **"Join Room"**
4. Grant camera/microphone permissions when prompted

#### Step 3: Verify Connection

**On Alice's screen:**
- Should see Bob's video feed appear (labeled "Bob")
- Participant count updates to: `2 participants`
- Status notification: "Bob joined"
- Can hear Bob's audio

**On Bob's screen:**
- Should see Alice's video feed appear (labeled "Alice")
- Participant count: `2 participants`
- Can hear Alice's audio

#### Step 4: Test Controls

**Alice toggles her video off:**
1. Click the video button (üìπ)
2. Alice's video should disappear on both screens
3. Bob still sees Alice's participant badge

**Bob toggles his audio off:**
1. Click the microphone button (üé§)
2. Bob's audio should be muted
3. Alice can no longer hear Bob

**Toggle back on to verify it works**

#### Step 5: Leave Room

**Bob leaves:**
1. Click **"Leave Room"**
2. Bob returns to setup screen
3. On Alice's screen:
   - Bob's video disappears
   - Participant count updates to: `1 participants`
   - Status notification: "Bob left"

## üîç Database Verification

### Check Supabase Dashboard

After creating/joining rooms:

#### 1. Verify Rooms Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM rooms ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** See your room with correct `room_code`

#### 2. Verify Participants Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM participants WHERE room_id = '<your-room-id>';
```

**Expected:** See all active participants

#### 3. Check Signaling Messages (Optional)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM signaling_messages;
```

**Note:** Messages may be empty if using Broadcast (which is recommended)

## üé≠ Edge Cases

### Case 1: Same User, Multiple Tabs

**Steps:**
1. Alice creates room in Tab 1
2. Alice joins same room in Tab 2

**Expected:**
- Two separate peer IDs
- Alice sees herself twice
- Works but not recommended

### Case 2: Room Code Reuse

**Steps:**
1. Create room: `TEST1`
2. Everyone leaves
3. Try to create new room with code: `TEST1`

**Expected:**
- New room created (different ID)
- Or error if code collision (unlikely with random generation)

### Case 3: Maximum Participants

**Steps:**
1. Fill room with 10 participants
2. Try to join as 11th user

**Current Behavior:**
- Allows joining (no limit enforced in code yet)
- Performance degrades

**Improvement:** Add max participant check
